## Project Reunion (C#) Version [Current]

With Windows App SDK 1.0.0 Experimental1, this application is now deployable, so I'll continue with this version.

<s>The tool developed under Project Reunion 0.8 and Win UI 3 is discontinued due to it's deploying issue.</s>

> <s>*Project Reunion* aka *Windows App SDK* won't support unpackaged distribution of *Win UI 3* win32 apps before 1.0 launch in Q4 2021)</s>

## Python + Tkinter Version [Planning]

A Python + Tkinter rework of this tool is under development as a replacement.
